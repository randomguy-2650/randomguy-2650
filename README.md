# Welcome! 👋

- I am a front‐end developer who mostly works with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and occasionally TypeScript. 🌐
- Many projects are available publicly through GitHub. 🐈‍⬛
- Definitely not an expert at CI/CD. 🤖🤔
- Everything here is metric‐only. Imperial units confuse me, and frankly, I’m okay with that. 🤷
- Working on Placer Toolkit, which currently is in the pre‐release stage. 👀

<!-- Hide this callout after this date: 1 March 2026 -->
> [!NOTE]
> Many Placer‐related repositories, like Placer Toolkit, have been moved to the [Placer Toolkit organisation](https://github.com/placer-toolkit). Old links will redirect to the new location.
